## Problem Statement

Manual counting of silkworms in trays or baskets is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and susceptible to human error, especially in large-scale sericulture operations.

The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent computer vision system capable of:

- Detecting individual silkworms in an image
- Estimating the total number of silkworms
- Providing accurate object localization using bounding boxes
- Delivering an interactive web application for real-time counting

This solution automates the counting process, reducing manual effort while improving consistency and scalability.

# Methodology

1. Load the trained YOLO11 model.
2. Upload an image containing silkworms.
3. Perform object detection.
4. Draw bounding boxes around detected silkworms.
5. Count detected instances.
6. Display analytics and visualizations.
7. Allow users to download results.
